Our vision for the SYPRES initiative was recently published in [_Nature Mental Health!_]<https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-024-00373-4>
We are so thrilled to outline the need for living systematic reviews in clinical psychedelic research, and share our vision for meeting the challenge.
Look out for more exciting news this year, including the launch of our dashboard and Phase I of SYPRES!
