### About this page
Welcome to the landing page for our living systematic review and meta-analysis on psilocybin for depression symptoms!
Here we provide an overview on our latest results, currently up-to-date with our most recent preprint.

### Study selection
We identified 2,231 studies from our [searches](/docs/datasets/psilodep_search/).
Of these, 61 passed initial title and abstract screening, while 12 reports (711 participants) were included after full-text review, with 9 reports meeting inclusion criteria for our primary model.

### Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias

![](/images/study_characteristics_v3.png)

*Table 1: Summary of RCTs on psilocybin for depressive symptoms.
Study endpoints are the reported primary endpoints for each study and given in weeks since the final dose.
Summary statistics across studies (blue rows) were calculated as weighted averages.
Overall mean age was calculated using the median age from Grob 2011.
*N for these studies reflect the number of participants in the high and low dose groups.
Goodwin 2022 and Krempien 2023 contained 75 and 18 participants in the medium dose arms, respectively.
These arms are included in the database, but not used in the present analyses with the exception of the Goodwin 2022 medium dose arm in the alternate dosing for Goodwin et al. sensitivity analysis.
US = United States; CH = Switzerland; CA = Canada; Multi = multi-site.
Goodwin was conducted at sites across the US, CA, UK, and European Union.
MDD = major depressive disorder; TRD = treatment-resistant depression; AUD = alcohol use disorder.*

Randomization = bias due to randomization process;
Deviations = bias due to deviations from intended interventions;
Missingness = bias due to missing outcome data;
Measurement = bias due to measurement of the outcome;
Selection = bias due to selection of the reported results;
Overall = overall risk of bias;
BDI = Beck Depression Inventory; GRID-HAMD = Grid Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression; MADRS = Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale; QIDS-SR = Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report.*
