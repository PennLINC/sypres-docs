### About this page
Welcome to the landing page for our living systematic review and meta-analysis on psilocybin for depression symptoms!
Here we provide an overview on our latest results, currently up-to-date with our most recent preprint.

### Study selection
We identified 2,231 studies from our [searches](/docs/datasets/psilodep_search/).
Of these, 61 passed initial title and abstract screening, while 12 reports (711 participants) were included after full-text review, with 9 reports meeting inclusion criteria for our primary model.

### Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias

Our database consists of XXX effect sizes generated from 12 studies, covering multiple depression instruments, outcome types (e.g. endpoint, change-score, or dichotomous), and time-points (from baseline to over 6 months).
As shown in Table 1, primary endpoints ranged from 2 to 7 weeks, with an average endpoint of 4 weeks.
The primary outcome instrument was chosen hierarchically, with the primary outcome identified by the study receiving preference if it measured depression, followed by a preference for clinician-rated depression measures.

Study endpoints are the reported primary endpoints for each study and given in weeks since the final dose.
Summary statistics across studies (blue rows) were calculated as weighted averages.
Overall mean age was calculated using the median age from Grob 2011.
*N for these studies reflect the number of participants in the high and low dose groups.
Goodwin 2022 and Krempien 2023 contained 75 and 18 participants in the medium dose arms, respectively.
These arms are included in the database, but not used in the present analyses with the exception of the Goodwin 2022 medium dose arm in the alternate dosing for Goodwin et al. sensitivity analysis.
US = United States; CH = Switzerland; CA = Canada; Multi = multi-site.
Goodwin was conducted at sites across the US, CA, UK, and European Union.
MDD = major depressive disorder; TRD = treatment-resistant depression; AUD = alcohol use disorder.*


We assessed study bias using Cochrane’s Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (Higgins et al., 2019; Sterne et al., 2019), which is the standard approach for bias assessment in randomized controlled trials. We focused our assessment specifically on primary outcome variables. In studies with multiple primary outcomes or where the primary outcome was not a depression measure, we evaluated the outcome selected for our primary meta-analysis. Furthermore, we limited our bias assessment to pre-crossover data only. If information pertinent to assessment of risk of bias was not available, authors were contacted via email.

The RoB 2.0 tool examines five potential bias sources: randomization procedures, deviations from the intended protocol, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, and selective reporting.
Each domain contains several questions rated on a four-level scale ranging from ‘yes’ to ‘no’, including an option for insufficient information.
Domain-level and overall study bias ratings are classified as low, medium, or high according to a predetermined algorithm (Sterne et al., 2019).
While this algorithm guides assessment, evaluators may justifiably override automated bias determinations when specific concerns warrant greater or lesser emphasis than the algorithm suggests.

Randomization = bias due to randomization process;
Deviations = bias due to deviations from intended interventions;
Missingness = bias due to missing outcome data;
Measurement = bias due to measurement of the outcome;
Selection = bias due to selection of the reported results;
Overall = overall risk of bias;
