               An initiative for living-evidence synthesis in clinical psychedelic research.
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          Renewed interest in psychedelics as treatments for mental disorders and symptoms has produced a rapidly growing body of research across public and private spheres over the last decade.
          However, there are substantial challenges in synthesizing evidence from available data to inform both clinical decision-making and policy.

     <p>
          We are establishing a series of living systematic reviews (LSRs) as a means to navigate the dynamic and rapidly burgeoning evidence base.
          Our publicly available online dashboard, SYPRES, adheres to the principles of open science, transparency, and data accessibility.
          By providing a comprehensive and continuously updated repository of meta-analyses, we aim to support researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and patients in making informed decisions about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.

               Reproducible and open science
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          Every element of SYPRES is open and reproducible – including database searches, data extraction, data processing, and all analyses.
          SYPRES thus combines open data and open code to maximize reproducibility and enhance confidence.
          This is accomplished in part through our partnership with <a href="https://www.metapsy.org">Metapsy</a>.
          All Metapsy databases are compiled using rigorous scientific standards. Databases are updated regularly, and each search step is documented on openly accessible repositories.
          Following the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>, all databases are versioned upon release and digital object identifiers (DOIs) are minted. This means that all databases and their versions are easily accessible to the research community.
          The goal of Metapsy is to create a centralized hub for <a href="https://docs.metapsy.org/general/#mard">meta-analytic research domains</a> (MARDs) in a consistent, transparent and accessible way.
