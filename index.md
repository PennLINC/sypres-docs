               An initiative for living-evidence synthesis in clinical psychedelic research.

     <p>
          Renewed interest in psychedelics as treatments for mental disorders and symptoms has produced a rapidly growing body of research across public and private spheres over the last decade.
          However, there are substantial challenges in synthesizing evidence from available data to inform both clinical decision-making and policy.

               SYPRES: A public resource
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          We propose the establishment of living systematic reviews (LSRs) as a means to navigate the dynamic and rapidly burgeoning evidence base.
          Our publicly available online dashboard, SYPRES, will adhere to the principles of open science, transparency, and data accessibility.
          By providing a comprehensive and continuously updated repository of meta-analyses, we aim to support researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and patients in making informed decisions about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics.

               Reproducible and open science
          </b>
     </p>
     <p>
          Every element of SYPRES is open and reproducible â€“ including database searches, data extraction, data processing, and all analyses.
          SYPRES thus combines open data and open code to maximize reproducibility and enhance confidence.
